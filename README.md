### Web widget version 

A web widget version of the Beta Labs Client was implemented before the Qt version. The web widget example demonstrates how to use the [Guarana UI library](http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/Guarana_UI:_a_jQuery-Based_UI_Library_for_Nokia_WRT ) components in the user interface. In addition, the application demonstrates how to enable dynamic scaling to different orientations by changing the style sheets (CSS) on the fly. The application is compatible with Symbian^3 and Symbian S60 5th Edition devices and it has been optimised for the touch UI. See [porting consideration wiki page](https://github.com/nokia-developer/beta-labs-client/wiki/Porting-Considerations) to learn how the WRT version was ported to Qt.
